# Online Piano

This is my A Level Computer Science coursework project.

## Goals

In this project, I aimed to create an environment for learning and teaching the piano. I decided to use JS React to design a user-friendly website and 
make an interactive online piano.

### Why JS React?
I decided to use React as it is easy to design a nice looking website and is a highly versatile library for creating interactive UIs.
I think that it made my life a lot easier and while it has its drawbacks it was mostly beneficial.
